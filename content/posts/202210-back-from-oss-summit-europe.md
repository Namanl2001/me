title: Back from OSS summit Europe, 2022

Hola! :wave: I attended OSS summit EU between 13-16 September, 2022 in Dublin, Ireland. In this blog I'll be briefing about my experience during the whole trip.

OSS summit EU will be closest to my heart as it was my first in-person conference and the first time I traveled internationally. Huge shoutout to the Linux Foundation for granting the scholarship and making this possible.

*fun fact: I received my passport with Ireland visa 3 days before leaving India.*

Contributing to open source projects is the best way to learn, but participating in community events should not be overlooked. And when we work on Kubernetes platforms, what’s better than going to conferences like the OSS summit?

For those who aren’t familiar with the OSS summit, *“it’s the premier event organized by the Linux Foundation for open source developers, technologists, and community leaders to collaborate, share information, solve problems and gain knowledge, furthering open source innovation and ensuring a sustainable open source ecosystem.”*

### :point_right: Why attend the OSS summit?
- Find out how others have used open source projects to gain efficiencies.
- Gain a competitive advantage by learning about the latest in innovative open solutions.
- Find out what industry-leading companies and projects are doing in the future and where technologies are headed.

Are you ready to dive in?

### :point_right: Takeaway 1: Kubernetes has reached critical mass adoption
One of the major things coming out of the conference was the broad-based adoption of Kubernetes. There were many exciting sessions — *‘Bringing ML Workflows to Heterogeneous Cloud Native Machine Learning Platforms’* by IBM, and the University of Cape Town talk on cloud-native network functions for their 5G networks are two great examples of cloud-native adoption across industries.

### :point_right: Takeaway 2: Security and software supply chain are, and continue to be top of mind concerns
Managing a tight security posture with Kubernetes is a big challenge. With recent breaches like Cryptojacking, Solarwinds, software supply chain, and software BOM came up as a topic in multiple sessions.
There are a lot of companies working on multiple aspects of this domain, including Runtime security, Network security, observability, etc., but these are still early days for them, and container security continues to be a significant customer pain point and strategic opportunity for cybersecurity vendors to grow their business.

### :point_right: Sponsors Showcase

This was one of the best parts of the summit since in this I was able to learn and network with a lot of like-minded folks working in different companies, from different countries, and on different projects. Obviously collected many cool swags :wink:

### :point_right: Fun events organized by the Linux Foundation

### :point_right: Other fun activities

I also went out with the other folks from India to visit the Trinity college, Cliff of Howth and Malahide Castle.

While retuning to India I had a long layover in Dubai, so I arranged a UAE visa and went out to explore Dubai solely. In just 12 hours, I covered Jumeriah beach, went to the 125th floor of Burj Khalifa, also visited Dubai Mall and Dubai Aquarium.

### :point_right: Conclusion
I heard a lot that “Open source can take you to places,” and now I believe it :)

Being an undergraduate student, this was an incredible opportunity. I can’t express in words the learnings (both tech & non-tech) and exposure I got through this trip. Looking forward to attending (and speaking) more in-person events in the future.
