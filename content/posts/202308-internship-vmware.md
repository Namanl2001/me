title: Inside VMware; 17 Months of Tech and Growth
---

Hey everyone! üëã I'm Naman Lakhwani, a final-year student at IIIT Gwalior, India. Buckle up because I'm about to take you on an extraordinary ride through the past 17 months of my life at VMware! üöÄ But before I delve into the heart of this experience, let me rewind a bit. Picture this: a young tech enthusiast on a quest for knowledge who had the opportunity to participate in programs like Google Summer of Code and the esteemed Linux Foundation mentorship program. Little did I know that these stepping stones would lead me to the incredible world of VMware! üòé

In this blog, I'll be your virtual tour guide, sharing the highs and the occasional bumps of working at a multinational powerhouse like VMware. So fasten your seatbelts and get ready for an inside look at the dynamic, ever-evolving world of tech, and the invaluable lessons learned along the way. üåü

Are you ready to dive right in? üîç

# The Interview Process
### Round 1: Embracing My Open-Source Legacy
The first technical interview was more than just a typical Q&A session. I got to discuss my past open-source work during my internships at Nirmata, LFX and GSoC periods, and to my delight, the interviewer had already seen my contributions to Kubernetes and even reviewed my PRs! This created an immediate connection and set the stage for an engaging conversation. While navigating through easy-medium coding challenges in GoLang, I felt an edge knowing that my hard work had already earned some positive feedback.

### Round 2: The Unexpected Twist
I thought the next technical round would be like the first, but the interviewer surprised me with a low-level system design question. Even though I felt a bit nervous and had some self-doubts, I pushed those thoughts away. I realized I had a supportive interviewer cheering for me, so I kept going. Their hints and help guided me to find the solution, and this round became a story of how I stayed determined and grew through the experience.

### Round 3: The Managerial Connection
A casual discussion with my future manager followed, where we explored my interests, past work, and how I thrive in collaborative environments. Their genuine interest in my journey reassured me that VMware was the perfect fit for my aspirations.

### Round 4: HR round
In the final HR round, typical questions intertwined with excitement about the starting date and work location. As the pieces fell into place, I could sense that my journey at VMware was about to begin.

# The VMware Work Culture
The work culture at VMware was amazing and incredibly supportive, impacting both my technical and non-technical growth. It wasn't just about the work; they cared about my overall well-being. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance was a priority, and they always reminded me to take care of my health. I never felt overwhelmed with excessive tasks. This environment truly made a difference in my journey. üå±

The team fully supported me throughout my ongoing college semesters. They understood that my situation was a bit unique, and they were flexible when it came to my exams and regular classes. There were days when I could only work during the late evenings, and they were completely understanding.

# Projects and Responsibilities
I had the incredible opportunity to dive into various projects that challenged and enriched my skills. One of my key responsibilities was automating the on-boarding process for release prow jobs from upstream Kubernetes to VMware Tanzu LTS release branches. This automation brought about a remarkable change ‚Äì it slashed manual configuration time by a whopping 99%, saving an average of 20 hours with each release cycle.

Another exciting project I tackled was the development of a containerD runtime interface specifically designed for dockerless CAPD. I also successfully migrated 7 critical Kubernetes controllers to a more secure and efficient contextual logging system. Also got a chance to be a part of the upstream Kubernetes v1.26 release team. This experience allowed me to contribute to a release with global impact.

I am immensely proud of the contributions I made and the skills I gained during my time at VMware.

# Team Collaboration Insights
Being the youngest member among the 18-strong team of software engineers, with experiences spanning from 5 to 20 years, was an incredible opportunity. Surprisingly, my limited experience never made me feel out of place. The senior team members were not only kind but also eager to assist me whenever needed. ü§ù 

Communication within the team flowed seamlessly, fostering an environment where everyone's opinions were valued. We were always encouraged to openly share our thoughts without hesitation, which significantly contributed to our collective progress. This collaborative and open atmosphere greatly resonated with me.

# Meeting my team in-person: A Memorable Break from Remote Work
In August 2022, a team offsite was called, gathering all of us at the VMware Bangalore office. Notably, this included team members from Paris and Germany ‚Äì a testament to VMware's global reach. üåç Being my second time in Bangalore, the experience was a perfect blend of business and leisure. The week was undoubtedly one of the most productive I've ever had. Our schedule was packed, beginning at 10 AM sharp, with meetings stretching into the evening. The discussions were vital as we had an array of important matters to tackle. This gave me complete corporate vibes. üíº

But it wasn't all about work; Amid meetings, we found time for team-building activities and dinners. And on a free day, we embarked on a memorable adventure to Nandi Hills, setting out at the early hour of 4 AM, witnessing a beautiful sunrise and enjoying an authentic South Indian dosa. Later, we satisfied our need for speed with go-karting and showcased our bowling skills, making it a day filled with laughter.

This gathering bridged the gap between virtual collaborations. Beyond business discussions, it added depth to our real connections.

# Impact and Achievements

I was fortunate to secure financial support from both VMware and the Linux Foundation. This support paved the way for me to attend two transformative industry events: OpenSource Summit Europe in Dublin, September 2022, and KubeCon in Amsterdam, April 2023. Both experiences collectively broadened my perspective and enriched my journey. üåü

Among the numerous recognitions I received, here are a couple.

# Key Takeaways
During my 17-month journey at VMware, I gained valuable technical insights, but the most significant lesson was rooted in kindness. Learning how to consistently extend kindness to everyone, regardless of their position, resonated deeply with me. I observed that as individuals ascend the hierarchy, their kindness tends to increase. "Always being kind" stands out as the primary lesson I'm carrying forward from my time at VMware. üòá

# Endings are just new beginnings in disguise
As I wrap up this chapter of my journey, I'm filled with gratitude for the experiences, learnings, and connections that VMware has generously bestowed upon me.
