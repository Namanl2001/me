**This page lists the recorded talks that I have given so far. Not much but it's a start.**

## :point_right: TLS in brief

Thanos is an open-source, CNCFâ€™s Incubated project that horizontally scales Prometheus to create a global-scale highly available monitoring system. It seamlessly extends Prometheus in a few simple steps and it is already used in production by hundreds of companies that aim for high multi-cloud scale for metrics while keeping low maintenance cost. In this talk I covered TLS's (Transport Layer Security) basic concepts and it's implementation in the Thanos project.
