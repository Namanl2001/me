Hey there, Iâ€™m Naman Lakhwani, holding a Master's degree from IIIT Gwalior, India. My journey revolves around diving into the depths of various CNCF's open-source projects, continuously learning and contributing. Away from the world of code, I challenge myself with daily weightlifting workout sessions to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, I enjoy reading self-growth books and spending quality time with my family. 

*Fun fact* : Many people assume me short, but I'm 191 cm ;)
