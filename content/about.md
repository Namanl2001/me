Hey there, I'm Naman Lakhwani, currently in my final year at IIIT Gwalior, India. My journey revolves around diving into the depths of various CNCF's open-source projects, continuously learning and contributing. Beyond the keyboard, I challenge myself with daily weightlifting sessions for a healthy lifestyle.

As a keen listener, I believe in the power of understanding through conversations. When I'm not immersed in coding, you'll find me engrossed in self-growth books and cherishing moments with my family. I observe the world around me, and always seeking to grasp its essence. My spiritual side keeps me grounded, as I find immense belief in the divine.

*Fun fact* : Many people assume me short, but I'm 191 cm ;)
