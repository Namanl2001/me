Hey there, I'm Naman Lakhwani, currently in my final year at IIIT Gwalior, India. My journey revolves around diving into the depths of various CNCF's open-source projects, continuously learning and contributing. Away from the world of code, I challenge myself with daily weightlifting workout sessions to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, I enjoy reading self-help books and spending quality time with my family.

As a keen listener, I believe in the power of understanding through conversations. I observe the world around me and try to understand its fundamentals. My deep spiritual beliefs help to keep me grounded. 

*Fun fact* : Many people assume me short, but I'm 191 cm ;)
